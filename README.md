# Brazilian Population Density Maps

This repository contains code and data processing workflows to analyze and visualize **population density in Brazilian municipalities** using the **2022 Census (IBGE)** and **projections for 2050**.  

It generates both **static maps (JPG, 1200 dpi)** and exports data tables (Excel).

## 🚀 Features

- Load and preprocess IBGE census data (1970–2022).
- Forecast **population up to 2050** using econometric models.
- Compute **municipal density (hab/km²)** for each period.
- Produce:
  - **Static maps** with state boundaries and labels.
  - **Excel tables** with historical and projected data.
